Certainly! Let's break down the code line by line:

python
Copy code
class Solution:
This line declares a class named Solution.

python
Copy code
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
This line defines a method named longestPalindrome within the Solution class. It takes a string s as input and returns a string. The self parameter refers to the instance of the class.

python
Copy code
        def check_palin(s):
This line defines a nested function named check_palin. This function takes a string s as input and returns True if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), otherwise it returns False.

python
Copy code
            return (s==s[::-1])
This line checks if the string s is equal to its reverse (s[::-1]). If it is, then the function returns True, indicating that s is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns False.

python
Copy code
        for length in range(len(s), 0, -1):
This line starts a loop that iterates over the range of integers from the length of the input string s down to 1, moving in steps of -1. This loop controls the length of substrings that will be checked for being palindromes, starting from the length of the entire string and decreasing down to 1.

python
Copy code
            for start_index in range(0, len(s) + 1 - length):
This line starts another loop that iterates over the range of possible starting indices for substrings of the current length being considered. The range starts from 0 and goes up to len(s) + 1 - length. This ensures that the substrings being checked don't exceed the length of the original string.

python
Copy code
                if check_palin(s[start_index:(start_index + length)]):
This line checks if the substring of length length starting from start_index in the string s is a palindrome. It does this by calling the check_palin function with the substring as input.

python
Copy code
                    return s[start_index:(start_index + length)]
If the substring is a palindrome, this line returns the substring, as it is the longest palindrome found starting from the current starting index and of the current length.
